    <div class="content"><p>
	In spring 2013, the world was alert to the possibility that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad might use chemical weapons to subdue the rebels with whom for two years he had fought a devastating civil war. Syria had admitted it had chemical weapons: blister agents, mustard gas, sarin, and VX nerve agent. Even without their use, the war by April 2013 had cost over 70,000 lives&mdash;at least half civilians&mdash;and created 800,000 refugees.</p>
<p>
	Al-Assad was on notice that the global community would not sit idly by were chemical weapons detonated. On August 20, 2012, US President Barack Obama had warned that chemical weapons constituted a &ldquo;red line&rdquo;: their use would trigger a major, if unspecified, response from the US and presumably its allies. For al-Assad, chemical weapons might indeed deliver victory. But counter-intuitively, his opponents also had reason to hope he crossed the &ldquo;red line&rdquo; because that would mean US assistance. Since December 2012, there had been a rising crescendo of unsubstantiated charges of just such chemical attacks.</p>
<div style="float:right;padding:10px">
	<img src="../../files/photos/1141/GP&#32;logo.png" /></div>
<p>
	It was in this atmosphere that <em>GlobalPost</em> (GP) Senior Correspondent Tracey Shelton crossed back into Syria on April 15. The Australian-born reporter had covered the war since February 2012. Friends in Aleppo immediately told her there had been a chemical attack the previous day, in the neighborhood of Sheikh Maqsoud. Shelton walked there to check it out. What she found prompted her to contact GP: she might have stumbled onto the kind of chemical attack President Obama had in mind.</p>
<p>
	Over the next two weeks, Shelton located and visited the site of the attack, and traveled to a nearby city to interview hospital personnel who had tended to the dead and wounded. She collected photos and video and interviewed witnesses. But by the time she filed on April 28, she was no longer sure just what the story was. Locals were convinced it was a sarin attack; she was less certain.</p>
<p>
	Shelton&rsquo;s editors checked with weapons experts to help determine what exactly she had uncovered. The US media was all too aware that President George W. Bush had ordered a 2003 attack on Iraq based on claims, later proved baseless, that dictator Saddam Hussein had a battle-ready arsenal of biological and chemical weapons. Critics had subsequently pointed to the failure of the press to challenge the government&rsquo;s assertions. In 2013, GP&rsquo;s editors were mindful of Obama&rsquo;s &ldquo;red line&rdquo; and the potential consequences of a news report that declared it crossed.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	By Tuesday, April 30, the GP editors were convinced that Sheikh Maqsoud had not suffered a sarin attack. But it had experienced an attack with a chemical; several people had died and others were severely affected by it. <em>GlobalPost</em> was still new, in business only since October 2008 and resolved to build a reputation for credibility. How could it convey simultaneously what Shelton had discovered, what the locals had experienced, and what the experts had concluded? How should it report on a chemical attack that had not been the worst-case scenario?</p>
